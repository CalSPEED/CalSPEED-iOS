The app conducts a two-phase test including initial testing and results validation in order to ensure statistically significant measurements. Test your upload speed, download speed, message delay (latency), and message delay variation (jitter) using CalSPEED iOS app. 
The first two metrics measure your Internet usage experience, while the second two measure the quality of your data connection.
